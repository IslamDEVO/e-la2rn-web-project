        Desktop Programming divided by 3 is .Net, Java and Delphi. .Net Programming language is Visual Basic (VB), C ++ and C sharp. While web programming divided by 3 is PHP, ASP and HTML. And for mobile programming used is J2ME. Each programming has advantages and disadvantages of each. Excess Desktop Programming is no need to be online in the run, while the shortcomings that have to install the program or consuming disk space. Desktop Programming skills in using what you get from a variety of ways, such as by way of self-taught with tutorial guides that can be searched on the Internet, learned of the lecture or by means of classroom lessons mengikutis Desktop Programming with the guidance of the professionals in their field. By using Desktop Programming Course is the most convenient and most widely performed. Advantage program courses include the costs tend to be much cheaper, relatively short learning process as well as the professional teaching staff that is owned by the course program.

        <h2>1)Desktop Programming </h2>
        <p>
  
        it is tempting to say that it is useless to define a desktop program because everyone knows what it is.  But for our purposes letâ€™s say the term refers to any program that does not need a browser to run on your computer.  This is a useful definition since when contemplating the creation of a new program the decision of whether the program should run in a browser or not is a key first decision.

        <h2>2)Mobile application development  </h2>
        <p>is a term used to denote the act or process by which application software is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes, hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU 28 members, 60% of which are mobile app developers.[1]

        As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is also essential in the creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI considers constraints, contexts, screen, input, and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is mainly for an understandable, user-friendly interface. The UI of mobile apps should: consider users' limited attention, minimize keystrokes, and be task-oriented with a minimum set of functions. This functionality is supported by mobile enterprise application platforms or integrated development environments (IDEs).

        Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile application servers, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure.
