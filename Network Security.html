        <h2>Computer Network Security !?</h2>
        <img src="resources/img/img3.jpg" width="100%" height="200px">
        <p>"Network security" refers to any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologies. Effective network security manages access to the network. It targets a variety of threats and stops them from entering or spreading on your network
        </p>
        <div class="section-heading">
                <h2>How does network security work?</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats.</p>
        <div class="section-heading">
                <h2>How do I benefit from network security?</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Digitization has transformed our world. How we live, work, play, and learn have all changed. Every organization that wants to deliver the services that customers and employees demand must protect its network. Network security also helps you protect proprietary information from attack. Ultimately it protects your reputation.</p>
        <div class="section-heading">
                <h2>Types of network security</h2>
                <div class="line"></div>
        </div>
        <h3><b>1) Access control</b></h3>
        <p>Not every user should have access to your network. To keep out potential attackers, you need to recognize each user and each device. Then you can enforce your security policies. You can block noncompliant endpoint devices or give them only limited access. This process is network access control (NAC).
        </p>
        <h3><b>2) Antivirus and Antimalware Software</b></h3>
        <p>"Malware," short for "malicious software," includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Sometimes malware will infect a network but lie dormant for days or even weeks. The best antimalware programs not only scan for malware upon entry, but also continuously track files afterward to find anomalies, remove malware, and fix damage.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>3) Application security</b></h3>
        <p>Any software you use to run your business needs to be protected, whether your IT staff builds it or whether you buy it. Unfortunately, any application may contain holes, or vulnerabilities, that attackers can use to infiltrate your network. Application security encompasses the hardware, software, and processes you use to close those holes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>4)Data Loss</b></h3>
        <p>Organizations must make sure that their staff does not send sensitive information outside the network. Data loss prevention, or DLP, technologies can stop people from uploading, forwarding, or even printing critical information in an unsafe manner.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>5)Email security</b></h3>
        <p>Email gateways are the number one threat vector for a security breach. Attackers use personal information and social engineering tactics to build sophisticated phishing campaigns to deceive recipients and send them to sites serving up malware. An email security application blocks incoming attacks and controls outbound messages to prevent the loss of sensitive data.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>6)FireWalls</b></h3>
        <p>Firewalls put up a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. They use a set of defined rules to allow or block traffic. A firewall can be hardware, software, or both. Cisco offers unified threat management (UTM) devices and threat-focused next-generation firewalls.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>7)Intrusion prevention systems</b></h3>
        <p>An intrusion prevention system (IPS) scans network traffic to actively block attacks. Cisco Next-Generation IPS (NGIPS) appliances do this by correlating huge amounts of global threat intelligence to not only block malicious activity but also track the progression of suspect files and malware across the network to prevent the spread of outbreaks and reinfection.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>8)Mobile device security</b></h3>
        <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting mobile devices and apps. Within the next 3 years, 90 percent of IT organizations may support corporate applications on personal mobile devices. Of course, you need to control which devices can access your network. You will also need to configure their connections to keep network traffic private.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>9)Network segmentation</b></h3>
        <p>Firewalls put up a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. They use a set of defined rules to allow or block traffic. A firewall can be hardware, software, or both. Cisco offers unified threat management (UTM) devices and threat-focused next-generation firewalls.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>10)VPN</b></h3>
        <p>A virtual private network encrypts the connection from an endpoint to a network, often over the Internet. Typically, a remote-access VPN uses IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer to authenticate the communication between device and network.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>11)Web security</b></h3>
        <p>A web security solution will control your staff’s web use, block web-based threats, and deny access to malicious websites. It will protect your web gateway on site or in the cloud. "Web security" also refers to the steps you take to protect your own website.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>12)Wireless security</b></h3>
        <p>Wireless networks are not as secure as wired ones. Without stringent security measures, installing a wireless LAN can be like putting Ethernet ports everywhere, including the parking lot. To prevent an exploit from taking hold, you need products specifically designed to protect a wireless network</p>
