          is a telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link. The connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media.

          Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes.[1] Nodes can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, servers as well as networking hardware. Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. In most cases, application-specific communications protocols are layered (i.e. carried as payload) over other more general communications protocols. This formidable collection of information technology requires skilled network management to keep it all running reliably.

          Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications as well as many others. Computer networks differ in the transmission medium used to carry their signals, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network's size, topology and organizational intent. The best-known computer network is the Internet.

It's recommended users with little or no community experience finish a Network+ official certification before moving onto their particular MCSE or CNE official certification.

        <h3><b>1 )CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)</b></h3>
        <p> is an information technology (IT) certification from Cisco. CCNA certification is an associate-level Cisco Career certification.

            The Cisco exams have changed several times. In 2013, Cisco announced an update to its certification program that "aligns certification and training curricula with evolving industry job roles."[1] There are now several different types of Cisco-Certified Network Associate, with "CCNA Routing and Switching" being closest to the original CCNA focus; other types of CCNA focus on security, cloud, collaboration, security operations, design, data center technologies, industrial plants, service providers, and wireless.[2][3]

            The content of the exams is proprietary.[4] Cisco and its learning partners offer a variet y of different training methods,[5] including books published by Cisco Press, and online and classroom courses available under the title "Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices."

            To achieve CCNA Routing and Switching certification, one must earn a passing score on Cisco exam #200-125, or combined passing scores on both the "Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices" ICND1 #100-105 and ICND2 #200-105 exams. Passing the ICND1 grants one the Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT)certification. Passing scores are set by using statistical analysis and are subject to change. At the completion of the exam, candidates receive a score report along with a score breakout by exam section and the passing score for the given exam. Cisco does not publish exam passing scores because exam questions and passing scores are subject to change without notice.[6]

            The 200-120 CCNA is the composite exam associated with the Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing &amp; Switching certification. This exam tests a candidate's knowledge and skills required to install, operate, and troubleshoot a small to medium size enterprise branch network. The topics include connecting to a WAN; implementing network security; network types; network media; routing and switching fundamentals; the TCP/IP and OSI models; IP addressing; WAN technologies; operating and configuring IOS devices; extending switched networks with VLANs; determining IP routes; managing IP traffic with access lists; establishing point-to-point connections; and establishing Frame Relay connections..

        <p> is an information technology (IT) certification from Cisco. CCNA certification is an associate-level Cisco Career certification.
            is someone in the IT industry who has achieved a Cisco career certification, which is a type of IT professional certification created by Cisco Systems,[1] best for network administrators &amp; engineers.

        <h3><b>3 ) Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert(CCIE)</b> </h3>
        <p>  is a technical certification offered by Cisco Systems.[1] The CCIE certifies the skills required of network engineers to plan, operate and troubleshoot complex, converged network infrastructures on a wide variety of Cisco equipment.

        The program is currently divided into six different areas of expertise or "tracks". The CCIE track in which one becomes certified determines the different aspects of networking technology. One may also choose to pursue multiple CCIE tracks in several different categories of Cisco technology: Routing &amp; Switching, Service Provider, Security, Collaboration, Data Center, and Wireless.

        <h3><b>1)Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate(MCSA)</b> </h3>
        <p>  is a certification program intended for people who seek entry-level jobs in an IT (information technology) environment. MCSA is a prerequisite for more advanced Microsoft certifications.<br>
        is the industry standard for demonstrating competence in managing and troubleshooting network environments based on the Windows Server 2003 operating systems.<br>
        Given the wide use of Microsoft Windows Server operating systems, many IT professions use the MCSA to prove their skills in this area. The MCS certification is especially relevant for: systems administrators, network administrators, information systems administrators, network operations analysts, or network technicians.<br>
        MCSA certifications can be completed in a wide range of online and campus-based training centers.

        <h3><b>2)Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate(MCSE)</b> </h3>
        <p>The Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) certification has long ruled the hearts and minds of those who work on Microsoft-based systems, servers and clouds. MCSE certifications focus on the latest technologies for servers, private clouds, business intelligence, messaging, communication and collaboration, SharePoint, enterprise devices and applications, and data platforms (SQL Server). Microsoft made some changes to its certification program in 2016, resulting in four new credentials for cloud platform and infrastructure, mobility, data management and analytics, and productivity.

        But when it comes to system administration certifications in general, the brightest lights are those that address Windows Server at the enterprise and server administrator levels. While these credentials don't all specifically use "system administrator" in their descriptions (though many do, or refer to servers instead), they all fall well inside the roles and responsibilities of system administration jobs. They're also in high demand in job postings and classified job advertisements.
