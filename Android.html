       <p class="lead">Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.  .</p>

      <p class="lead">
        Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance – a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. Beginning with the first commercial Android device in September 2008, the operating system has gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being 7.0 "Nougat", released in August 2016. Android applications ("apps") can be downloaded from the Google Play store, which features over 2.7 million apps as of February 2017. Android has been the best-selling OS on tablets since 2013, and runs on the vast majority[a] of smartphones. As of May 2017, Android has two billion monthly active users, and it has the largest installed base of any operating system.

        Android's source code is released by Google under an open source license, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services. Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices. Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. The extensive variation of hardware in Android devices causes significant delays for software upgrades, with new versions of the operating system and security patches typically taking months before reaching consumers, or sometimes not at all. The success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies

       <h2>Six Reasons To Learn android Developement </h2>
       <ul>
          <li type="square"> <p class="lead"><b>Open source code</b> – Make what you want
          The best part about Android operating system is its feature of being open source. More than before, a lot of electronic manufactures like Samsung, HTC &amp; Asus (to name a few!) have got access to the code which makes it easy for them to use it in their smartphones.

          According to IDC, the global share of Android in Smartphones is going to peak in 2015! Here is a detailed forecast:
          Since a lot of Android devices are getting more efficient and affordable, the size of the market is expected to grow. This goes to the extent where different versions of Android itself have been rolled out through companies like Cyanogen which rolled out Cyanogen mod (One plus one &amp; Micromax Yu Yureka anyone?).<br>

          <li type="square"><p class="lead"><b>
          Google Play Store–</b> The Huge App Market
          Every since Google rolled out its play store, the joy of experiencing app has only multiplied tenfold. There was a time when we all looked up to the iTunes store from Apple and sometimes getting an iphone was nearly impossible. But with the Google play store and Android smartphones access to apps has become so easy for all.
          <img src="resources/img/app-market.png" width="75%" height="300px">
          </p></li>

          <li type="square"><p class="lead">
            <b>Booming Job Prospects</b>
            As Android provides an interesting revenue model, a lot of organizations have a dedicated team for application development with hiring catching pace. The unique advantage of learning app development is that learners can choose to work or freelance. Similarly, once that person masters developing apps through Android it becomes easy to develop apps for other operating systems!

            The graph below is just an assumption of a person having knowledge of Java and where he/she could go from there
            <br>
            <img src="resources/img/salary.png" width="75%" height="300px">
            </p></li>
            <li type="square"><p class="lead">
            <b>Revenue Model</b>
            Did you know that the costliest app in Google play store is the Abu Moo collection app for $200! Weird but true. This app is especially made for rich people. More of that later, but the fact that Google allows developers to price their apps in the Google play store even at such higher prices makes it quite rewarding.

            Imagine that you are creating an app for roughly $1 and you launch it in Google and there are over 1.5 million Android devices activated each day! How much can you make even if 1% of the total Android users downloaded your app? You do the math…

            $1 X 1% X 1.5 Million = $15,000 !
            Different Models of Payment:
            App Download – Once the app is launched in the Google play store, the app developer can fix a price for the app and post download, Google will pay out after deducting play store charges.

            Ad-Revenue – This model is quite common for free apps where Google will pay out to developers in exchange for placing ads in the app. A lot of developers have benefited from this model.
            </p></li>

          <li type="square"> <p class="lead">
            <b>Penetration on Different devices</b>
            Android is everywhere. Let’s face it. Recently, the Moto 360 got launched to compete with Apple Smartwatch and then there is the Google glass powered by the Android operating system. Staggeringly, the total number of Android devices sold is 1,175,450,000!

            Some of the devices supported include Smart TVs, Smartphones, Tablets, Portable Media Players, Camera, VoIP Phones, Video game player, Car DVD Player, Car Systems, Smartwatches and even Drones…

            What’s in for the developer?
            It’s simple. Different devices offer different opportunities! Smart TV customers for example will have different expectation than Smartphone users when it comes to apps. Taking cue from this small insight, app developers can launch apps for each type of customer segment thereby widening their base and increasing their revenue many times.
          </p></li>
          <li type="square"> <p class="lead">
            <b> Gradual Learning Curve</b>
            There is a lot of inhibition among Android app developers over what they need to learn in order to develop Android apps. One has to agree that the person must be innovative, identify opportunities in the market and develop new ideas. But apart from that, here are some important skills:

            Java – It’s important to know Java because the Android applications have Java coding in it.

            XML – Secondly, XML is the second most important skill for Android app development since it enables you to work on the app layout and design..

      <h2>10 TIPS FOR BECOMING A SUCCESSFUL ANDROID DEVELOPER </h2>
      <ul>
        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue">  EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT, BUT NOT ESSENTIAL </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">

          You don’t really need to graduate from any IT school to become a successful coder. It’s definitely worth the time, but if you happened to pick the wrong direction in the past, don’t think you’ve lost your chances. I was that person for example. I’ve learnt most of the stuff on my own. Knowledge is all over the internet, just learn to look for it first.
        </p> </li>

        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue">  THE JOB PAYS WELL, BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">

          You’ll most probably fail if you picked software development just because you think it’s a good and easy way of making decent money. Without any love for the subject you will get stuck at some point. You might  also never see the money you’ve dreamed about because of it. Don’t make yourself miserable doing something you don’t really want just because it pays money. This is actually how bad software is made..
        </p> </li>

        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue"> PATIENCE IS THE KEY</font></h3>
          <p class="lead">

          Don’t fool yourself. As a coder you are gonna keep failing. My personal favorite movie character, Rocky Balboa, would say: This is how winning is done. The coding is about writing something and then spending most of the time making it work
        </p> </li>

          <h3><font color="blue">  PHONE “POWER USER” </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">

          This only applies to mobile development. You are never going to be a fine mobile developer if you don’t use your device regularly. You have to be enthusiastic about all the new cool apps and game that show up on your platform. It’s the source of your inspiration. Mobile development is kind of closed inside a set of guidelines – it’s a good practice to follow them. That doesn’t mean that you can’t be creative. Just keep them in mind. Your app should be an extension of the operating system it works on.
        </p> </li>

        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue"> BE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT YOUR JOB </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">


          If you made software development your hobby you’re on the right way to the success. If you have no commercial experience and no proper education, getting the first job might be tricky. Having some project of your own to show during your job interview will help a lot. It means you know something and you do it because you you want it. It’s super important for every decent recruiter.</p> </li>

        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue">DON’T BE AFRAID OF TAKING RISK </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">


          There will moments in your career when you will be able to pick the easy way of accomplishing your task or trying something experimental. I don’t refer only to technology. You might want to step out of strict rules of your company if you feel this is for the better. In the end of the day, the job you did is the most important.  This might not be the path preferred by everyone. It can be a rocky one, but if you got balls you should try walking it. Some say – no risk, no gain.

          <h3><font color="blue">DON’T BE THE BIGGEST FISH IN THE TANK </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">

          (my personal favorite.)
          If you decided to get into some development team, try to find one with at least one developer you consider better than yourself. He is the one you are going to learn most from. No matter how experienced you are, this job is about constant development of yourself as well. It’s good to have some mentor of your own.
        </p> </li>

        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue">DON’T UNDERSTIMATE GIT </font></h3>
          <p class="lead">


          It does not matter what is the platform you code on; GIT version control is something you will use constantly in every decent company or project of your own. You can never be too good at GIT. You probably can never master it as well. This thing is huge. Just try to use it as efficiently as possible. It’s especially important when working in team..</p> </li>
        <li type="square"> 
          <h3><font color="blue"> FIND A WAY OF YOURS</font></h3>
          <p class="lead">

          There is no such thing as best development process. This thing sometimes evolves with every project. Work it out with your team on on your own if you’re the lone wolf. Don’t let the process slow you down too much – it’s only worth it if the process systematize your work efficently.</p> </li>
